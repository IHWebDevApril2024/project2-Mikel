# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

THIS PROJECT CONSISTS OF A MOVIE-APP IN WHICH YOU CAN MARK THE MOVIES YOU'VE WATCHED, MAKE A WISH LIST (OR WHATEVER KIND OF LIST), EVALUATE THAT MOVIES, MAKE A COMMENT ON THEM...AND SHARE IT WITH YOUR PARTNERS!
