# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This project consists of a movie-app in which you can mark the movies you have watched and liked, making a favorite list (it can be added another "wish" list). 
The API I've taken the information from is TMDB. I have only taken the films to display them in popularity order. 
Besides, I have created another database with Supabase in which you can add films that you haven't seen in the API, edit them or even delete them.
The project has been implemented with React and written in JavaScript.

COMPONENTS

There are some components to render the information that I got from both the API and the created database in Supabase, and a Navbar and a Footer to display the different pages and how to contact me.

PAGES
 
I did some pages to show a homepage, the list of movies, a favorite section and a form to be able to create a new card for a film that it wasn't displayed.
